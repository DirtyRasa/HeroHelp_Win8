Hero Helper
===========
Hero Helper is a character planner for Diablo 3.
This app will eventually be available on the Windows Store.


Goal
====
My goal with this app is to provide an easy way for players to determine the effects of items on their stats.
A player will simply download their characters by entering their Battletag and start "modifying" the heroes items.
While the player "modifies" the heroes items, the detailed stats will update and show what's changed.

This will be helpfull for those of you that want to buy an item from the Auction House but are
unsure how it will effect you.
